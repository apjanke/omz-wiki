# omz-wiki

This is my quasi-fork of robbyrussel/oh-my-zsh's wiki.

There is no code in this repo. It exists only to provide a place for hosting the GitHub wiki for it.

This repo's wiki is *not* the main oh-my-zsh wiki. Do not link to it from external places. This is only a place 
for experimenting with prospective changes to the main wiki.
